# sound-off-backend

This is the repo for the api for a game I made at Flatiron School as part of the JavaScript course with two other students:
  - Claudia Maniscalchi (https://github.com/cmaniscalchi)
  - Jack Yeung (https://github.com/jyeung-se)

  Here is a link to the frontend repo: https://github.com/jaredianmills/sound-off-frontend

  And here is a link to the game on GitHub pages: https://jaredianmills.github.io/sound-off-frontend/
